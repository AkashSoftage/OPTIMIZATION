# OPTIMIZATION

Optimizing github pages for better performance involves various techniques such as minimizing files sizes, optimizing images, utilizing caching, and leveraging CDNs. Automating these optimizations using github actions can streamline the process.

1. Set up a github actions workflow. - Create a workflow file in your repository to define the optimization steps.
2. implement optimization 
3. commit and push workflow changes - once you've defined the optimization steps in the workflow file, commit the changes to your repository and push to the main branch. 
4. Monitor and improve
